/**
 * dsh-hub host half — the desktop shell over the web-app layer.
 *
 * Launch gating: the desktop window, the config API, and the settings
 * namespace are active ONLY when the process was started by this project —
 * the desktop shortcut or the `dsh-hub` command, both of which set
 * `DSH_HUB_LAUNCHED=1`. The cordis.patch.yml row is additionally
 * `disabled` under any other launch, so a plain command-line `dsh web` never
 * even mounts this plugin: no window, no client row in __DSH_BOOT__, nothing
 * injected.
 *
 * Config surface: the client settings card reads/writes the shell config
 * through this plugin's own HTTP routes (`/api/dsh-hub/config`).
 * This is deliberate — dsh's RPC `settings.describe` exposes only a
 * hard-coded allowlist in the api-proxy (third-party plugin namespaces are
 * "deferred work" per its source comment), so the supported pattern for
 * third-party config UIs is plugin-owned routes, exactly like dsh-web-ui's
 * packages (`/api/pet/*`, etc.). The settings namespace is still registered
 * via the official `installSettingsSection` for in-process consumers and for
 * the day the allowlist opens up.
 *
 * @module dsh-hub
