/**
 * RightSidebar — the mg-dsh-desktop right sidebar mounted as a body portal
 * (like dsh-better-sidebar), independent of the official details column so it
 * also works in blank/new conversations where the details column is forced
 * to 0. It mirrors the left sidebar's collapse/rail behavior and provides
 * three tabs:
 *  - Overview: context-token usage rendered as a fan/donut chart.
 *  - Files: current workspace file/folder tree, strictly synced to the
 *    current session's workspace.
 *  - Git: whether the workspace is a git repo, branch, and working-tree changes.
